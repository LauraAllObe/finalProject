Practice Panther A summer 2023 project. Project description: This Practice Panther implementation in C# uses the .NET MAUI. It should be noted that a Context Factory was used for creating the backend. This full-stack application features 5 models: Client, Project, Employee, Time, and Bill. Users may apply CRUD to each of these models (except for, of course, editing a bill). Clients and Projects may be closed (this is used to exemplify closing an active case or client to employee interaction). To close a client, all projects must first be closed. Time entries can be recorded manually or by using the timer popup for a project (this timer limits entries to greater than 10 minutes). Time entries must include a valid employee id, project id, and time. Users may undo any changes during the process of editing or adding a Client, Project, Employee, Time, or Bill. Delete features chain deletion (for example, deleting an employee deletes time entries associated with that employee and bills associated with those time entries). Once a time entry has been billed, it can no longer be edited. Bills can be made for an individual project or for a client as a whole. Please note project was made in year 2023, not 2022 as indicated by the title. Demonstration Video: https://youtu.be/4RhOKUSKGfs
